# FamilyLogger

This is a simple console application that allows the user to login to their account on the FamilyLogger website (https://familylogger.azurewebsites.net), logs keystrokes typed while it is open both to the console and to a text file, and pushes the contents of that text file to a database (The user can view this by logging into the aforementioned website).
