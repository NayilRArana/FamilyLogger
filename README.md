# FamilyLogger

This is a simple console application outputs all keys typed while it is open to a console window. This is the first ever C# program I developed.

## Getting Started

You can download the program by clicking the link and following the instructions: https://familylogger.azurewebsites.net/Download.aspx

## Highlights

The main method is heavily based on the code in the readme for the repository of the API that I used to make this (https://github.com/fabriciorissetto/KeystrokeAPI). I did add a little functionality; the current date is displyed at the top of the console window. A new function was made to facilitate this.
